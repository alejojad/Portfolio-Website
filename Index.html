                <h2> Alejandro Jad </h2>
                <p>I  am currently pursuing a B.S. degree, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, 
                    and I am on track to graduate in May 2025. I am a goal-oriented individual dedicated to 
                    continuous improvement and driving positive business impact. I possess strong problem-solving 
                    skills and leadership abilities, coupled with a high-level understanding of business and financial
                     concepts. My proficiency in the following languages: C++, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, along with my deep understanding of 
                     mathematical principles, allows me to excel in both technological and analytical domains. 
                     My goal is to further my growth and learning in these fields to contribute meaningfully 
                     to future endeavors.
                </p>
